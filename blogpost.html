            <p>On theater, we cancel distractions with dark and with the black box, further we focus in little details when the lights is in the precise angle. So is possible sensitize us with almost any word correctly said in time, intonation and form. Even better if you share any emotion.</p>
            <p>This not work for books. This not work for books. The books fight of other ways for your attention. In the first pages they have to draw a strong and solid environment, but at the same time attractive to stay there. The words flow faster and at the ritm of the reader, the same one who can be voracious, what causes a need por poetics to convey everything that the artist adds with his body and energy.</p>
            <p>Not is possible read theater. The theater has to be done.</p>
