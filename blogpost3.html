            <h1>The blood</h1>
            <p>On theater, the dramaturg and the actor fade and merge into something else. You don't recognize the text or the action. That unique presence is the blood that runs through the theater and fills the play with life. Both, in addition to being intelligent, are forced to leave their blood on stage.</p>
            <p>For me, the blood is not anything. Blood lives, and it does live, to connect the soul and the body. It is neither one nor the other. It is enough for the director to be intelligent, but in the end, only the text and the actor will remain. Everything can fail, the lights can go out, the stage can fall, there may be no director.</p>
            <p>In the end, the theater wants neither your effort, nor your intentions, not your technique. The theater wants your blood.</p>
