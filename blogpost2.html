            <h1>The compass</h1>
            <p>On theater, the text is a compass, not a map. A reference to find the emotion that the dramaturg has have in his pen. The soul of the play is like the human soul. Is determined? Is the same everyday? Is precise and perfect? Absolutly not. It's only that, a human soul.</p>
            <p>Is impressive and beautiful when an actor has every word in the correct place and every emotion on the precise level. Of course, that is exclusive reverence for some whimsical director, and intellectuals with all of Miller's work on mind. For me is most important see the emotional trip. From A to Z. Change. Like the humans.</p>
            <p>The text is a compass. And the truth is, I don't expect travelers to repeat the trip to the letter, but there has to be a trip, yes.</p>
